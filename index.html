				<h2>About the Khranicle Wordle</h2>
				<p>
					Google Search created an Easter egg when one searches for "Wordle", with the site's logo becoming an
					animated game of Wordle to find the word "Google".
					On February 10, the game was officially moved to The New York Times's website, with statistics
					carrying over; however, some players reported that their daily streaks reset after the switch.
